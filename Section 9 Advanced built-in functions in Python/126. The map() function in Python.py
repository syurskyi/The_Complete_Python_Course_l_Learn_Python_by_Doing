"""
The `map()` function is used to take an iterable and output a new iterable where each element has been modified
according to some function.

For example, this `map()`:
"""

friends = ['Rolf', 'Charlie', 'Anna']
friends_lower = map(lambda x: x.lower(), friends)

print(friends_lower)

print(list(friends_lower))

"""
This of course could be written (arguably better / more pythonically) as a list or generator comprehension:
"""

friends_lower = [friend.lower() for friend in friends]

friends_lower = (friend.lower() for friend in friends)

"""
However there is something to be said for using `map()` and *not* creating the useless `friend` variable that you need
to create for list comprehension.

I still think list comprehension is more pythonic and more readable.

However, if you already have the function you’re going to use defined, `map()` may not be such bad a choice. 
Here’s an example:
"""


class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data):
        return cls(data['username'], data['password'])


# imagine these users are coming from a database...

users = [
    {'username': 'rolf', 'password': '123' },
    {'username': 'tecladoisawesome', 'password': 'youaretoo' }
]

user_objects = map(User.from_dict, users)

"""
The option of using a list comprehension is slightly uglier, I feel:
"""

user_objects = [User.from_dict(u) for u in users]

"""
Although of course, using dictionary unpacking everything would be made much simpler… More on that in a coming section!
